#Parallax Effect

And what is the Parallax Effect?
In computer graphics, the Parallax effect is usually simulated with the technique of moving background images at a slower speed than foreground images, creating in our brain the illusion of depth in 2D planes.

The web is used most often on single-page sites, which involves the background moving at a slower rate in the foreground, creating a 3D effect when you scroll the page. In other words, 
parallax is a technique that causes an illusion of depth at the interfaces.
